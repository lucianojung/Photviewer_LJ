This is an JavaFX Programm code in IntelliJ (Version: 2018.2.4, Java 10.0.2).
You can let the Program show you images in a ListView and set one in the Center by clicking on it.
You also can start a Diashow of all Pictures using the MenuBar.

This was a voluntery University Project.
I practice using the MVC-Pattern, JavaFX Controls and reusable and clean Code.

I also updated UML-Diagrams and sample Images:
- Use Case-Diagramm
- Classdiagramm
- most important Sequencediagramms

Other Functions:
- set the Duration of the Diashow with a Button in the MenuBar
- get next or previous Image by clicking the Arrow-Buttons on the Bottom

The Optional-Branch has a few experimental Funktions which are not neccessary for my University Project.

You are welcome to post constructive criticism.
